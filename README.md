<div>TailWindTraders project This is a project for a class I did not take, but found it interesting and so followed along to make a small project for my portfolio. This is a fictional company (in business only 2 months), and while I would not put so much on each page, that was apparently the assignment.</p>
<p>Here you will find the screenshots (not interactive) of the report pages, as well as a screenshot of the dashboard (also not interactive). I had fun, and I hope you will enjoy it, too.</p>

<p><h3>Dashboard</h3>
The Power BI dashboard is meant to give a 'bird's eye' view of the situation at a glance. I would not put so much on one page, but that was the assignment.
