# Power-BI-Project
TailWindTraders project
This is a project for a class I did not take, but found it interesting and so followed along to make a small project for my portfolio.
This is a fictional company (in business only 2 months), and while I would not put so much on each page, that was apparently the assignment.

Here you will find the screenshots (not interactive) of the report pages, as well as a screenshot of the dashboard (also not interactive).
I had fun, and I hope you will enjoy it, too.
